# scripts

In the data folder, there's quite a few files...

character_list5.csv - this is the data that powers all of the calculations on polygraph.cool/films. It uses the most accurate script that we can find for a given film. People are understandably finding errors, so we will be updating this file as much as possible.

disney_films2.csv - this powers the films selected for the first chart.

meta_data7.csv - this is unique list of IMDB_IDs from the character_list file, with additional meta data, such as release year and domestic, inflation-adjusted gross.

genre_mapping.csv - this is a mapping of IMDB_IDs to genres.

The selected scripts and their sources are also publicly maintained here:
